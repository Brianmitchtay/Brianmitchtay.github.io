        For now I'm typing this all out in the atom code editor, not really the best place for creative writing, I'll have to sort out where and how to draft these before adding them to the HTML. Over time I intend to section things off a bit better so I have several modular pieces that I'm strapping together rather than making a whole new HTML page for every entry. Hell, maybe I'll just make the site a one pager and have it all right there on the front page. For now it seems to make sense for this kind of writing to just go with the long long infinite scroll to the right as I write long lines of.. "code".
