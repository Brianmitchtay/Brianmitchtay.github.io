Today is my last day house sitting for the mayor of Gustavus, it's really less about the house and more about her two cats - Porter and Minerva.
I'm convinced that they could take care of themselves all on their own, with the way they seem to have no trouble bringing home voles and chickadees to eat every day while Rachel and I are at work, but just to be safe we still feed them in the morning and evening.
There are alot of nice parts about setting yourself up in someone else's house for a week or so. In this case we got to see how simple you can live in a small rural town like Gustavus, and developed a hearty sense of appreciation for how nice our little cabin is with all the luxuries of running hot water and so much more space.
Tomorrow I'll go out on the Glacier Bay National Park dayboat tour where we'll pick David and Brittany up from their backcountry journey, hopefully they'll have nothing but smiles and good stories for me when I see them.

In other news I'm getting a decent hold on my second job as a kayak guide for Alaska Mountain Guides, so far I've seen about 25 breaching whales out at the point and haven't had a single client go home too disappointed, the hardest part honestly is coaching people through keeping their foot on the little pedals to control the rudder etc, and schlepping all the kayaks all around town - from the shop to the dock, from the dock to the boat, from the boat to the beach, and then all in reverse, in a single day, I'm happy to only be guiding a single trip a week or else I think my back would hurt too much!
